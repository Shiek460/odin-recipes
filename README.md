# Creating a first go at a webpage. 
- Working to develop an understanding of html layout and linking.
- Created 3 Recipe pages, including images, unordered lists, ordered lists, nesting of elements within each other to achieve desired appearance.
    - Edited image attributes as recommended by the lessons, after realizing that I had failed to specify image size in the display. My final one was a different size than the other two, which lead to me realizing my error.
